# Contributing Guide

We value your and our time, we created this Guidline to avoid unnecessary diffuculties with pull requests and contribution process.

Please read the text below **before starting your improvements** in order to help us make cooperation and reviewing experience as pleasent and effective as possible.

Not following these rules and procedures may entail closing issues or rejection of your work even if it's theoreticly adequate.

## Issues and Support

1. **Use Support Forum** - don't use GitHub Issues for personal questions and support requests. We're maintaining a [dedicated Support Forum](https://mdbootstrap.com/support/) for this purpose. This is also a go-to place for every suggestion, opinion, bugs, and issue reports - if you'd like to receive help as soon as possible. Reports posted on Support Forum are **prior to GitHub issues**.

2. **Check available resources** - always check [current issues](https://github.com/mdbootstrap/Angular-Bootstrap-with-Material-Design/issues) before opening your own. Also check [Support Forum](https://mdbootstrap.com/support/) and [Documentation](https://mdbootstrap.com/angular/) - most likely you'll find your answer there. Unchecked issues and duplicates will be closed immediatelly.

3. **Examine issue source** - MDB code is depending on other projects, mainly [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap). Don't open issues concerning sources we cannot influence. For example - lack of flexbox support for older IE versions is determined by Bootstrap not MDB.

4. **Check updates** - We resolve most of reported bugs and issues with every new release. Check if your MDB version is the latest. You can take a look at our [changelog](https://mdbootstrap.com/angular/changelog/) to find if your problem wasn't already taken care of. If you want to keep track on updates and bug fixes, the best way is joining our newsletter [here](https://mdbootstrap.com/angular/newsletter/).

5. **Be specific** - describe your case **in English**, clearly and with details. Attach code examples, screenshots, links and any other relevant resources.
